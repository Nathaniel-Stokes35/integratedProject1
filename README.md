<h1>Sprint 5: Integrated Project EDA</h1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using exploratory data analysis I am going to analyze a dataset of ESRB rated games, their sales from 2016 and, hypothetically, construct common trends to help predict the marketing for 2017 game launches. My goal is to help spot "big winners" for advertising plans.</br>
<h4>Integrated Project Outline</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Data
    	<ul>
    		<li>Lowercase column names</li>
    		<li>Convert datatypes and explain changes</li>
    		<li>handle null values and explain reasoning. (Including "TBD (To Be Determined)" values)</li>
    		<li>Calculate Total Sales and input total into a separate column for each game.</li>
    	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Analyze the data
    	<ul>
    		<li>Analyze how many games were released in different years. (Is the data for every period significant?)</li>
    		<li>Analyze how sales varied across platforms.
    			<ul>
    				<li>Choose platforms with the greatest total sales and build a distribution for each year.</li>
    				<li>Find Platforms that used to be popular but now have 0 sales. (How long does it take for new platforms to appear and old ones to fade?)</li>
    			</ul>
    		</li>
    		<li>What period should I take data from to project the model for 2017?</li>
    		<li>Only work with the data you find relevant, disregard the other years.</li>
    		<li>What platforms are leading in sales?(Which are growing or shrinking?) Select Several potentially profitable platforms</li>
    		<li>Build a box plot for the global sales of all games, by platform. Differences significant? Average sales on various platforms. Describe</li>
    		<li>How do reviews (user and professional) affect sales for any single platform.
    			<ul>
    				<li>Build a scatter plot to calculate the correlation between reviews and sales</li>
    				<li>Describe the results</li>
    			</ul>
    		</li>
    		<li>Compare Sales of the same game across platforms</li>
    		<li>Analyze the distribution of games by genre (What can we say about the most profitable genres?) Can we generalize about genres with high and low sales?</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Create a user profile for each region
    	<ul>
    		<li>For each region (NA, EU, JP) determine:
    			<ul>
    				<li>Top Five platforms: Describe variations in their market shares from region to region</li>
    				<li>The Top five Genres: Explain the Difference</li>
    				<li>Do ESRB ratings affect sales in individual regions?</li>
    			</ul>
    		</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Test the following Hypotheses:
    	<ol>
    		<li>Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC Platforms are the same</li>
    		<li>Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different</li>
    	</ol>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Set the Alpha threshold value</li>
    		<li>Explain how the null and alternative hypotheses were formulated</li>
    		<li>Explain what significance level was chosen to test the hypotheses and why.</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Write a General Conclusion and format the notebook</li>
</ol>
<h5>How the project will be evaluated</h5>
<ul>
	<li>How problems are described in the data</li>
	<li>How the dataset was prepared for analysis</li>
	<li>How distribution graphs were built and explained</li>
	<li>How was standard deviation and variance calculated</li>
	<li>How was the alternative and null hypotheses formulated>/li>
	<li>What methods were used went testing them</li>
	<li>Were the results explained from the tests</li>
	<li>Was the project structure followed and is the code neat and comprehensible</li>
	<li>What conclusions were made</li>
	<li>Were there clear, relevant comments at each step</li>
</ul>
